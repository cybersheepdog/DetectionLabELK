**Update:*** Updates coming soon.  I have been busy and will now have some free time to activiely work on this project.

DetectionLabELK is a fork from Chris Long's [DetectionLab](https://github.com/clong/DetectionLab) with ELK stack instead of Splunk.

This is a fork of cyberdefenders [DetectionLabELK](https://github.com/cyberdefenders/DetectionLabELK) which according to their github 
repo is no longer maintained as of may 2020.

### Some of the coming soon features are:
- Default IP address will be a different subnet to allow installation on the same host as DetectionLab.  I like to be able to use both Splunk and ELK.
    - Recent update to [DetectionLab](https://github.com/clong/DetectionLab) changed the default IP's to 192.168.58.X.  Default for this project will be 192.168.42.X.
- Default Box Names will be a different to allow for installation on same host using the same virtualizaiton software (Virtualbox, VMWare,etc.).
    - They will be:
        - logger_elk
        - dc_elk
        - wef_elk
        - win10_elk
- Ability to change default hostnames.
- Ability to change default domain.
- Ability to change the default IP addresses.
- Ability to choose between [Olaf Hartong's](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular) or [SwiftOnSecurity's](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config) sysmon configuration.  Current default is Olaf Hartong's.

## Description:

DetectionLabELK is the perfect lab to use if you would like to build effective detection capabilities. It has been designed with defenders in mind. Its primary purpose is to allow blueteams to quickly build a Windows domain that comes pre-loaded with security tooling and some best practices when it comes to system logging configurations. It can easily be modified to fit most needs or expanded to include additional hosts.

## Use cases:

A popular use case for DetectionLabELK is when you consider adopting MITRE ATT&CK framework and would like to develop detections for its tactics. You can use DetectionLabELK to quickly run atomic tests, see what logs are being generated and compare it to your production environment. This way you can:

- Validate that your production logging is working as expected.
- Ensure that your SIEM is collecting the correct events.
- Enhance alerts quality by reducing false positives and eliminating false negatives.
- Minimize coverage gaps.

## Deployment Options

1.  **Use Vagrant Cloud Boxes - ETA ~2 hours**.

    - [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) on your system.
    - [Install Packer](https://packer.io/downloads.html) on your system.
    - Install the Vagrant-Reload plugin by running the following command: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload`.
    - Download DetectionLabELK to your local machine by running `git clone https://github.com/cybersheepdog/DetectionLabELK.git` from command line OR download it directly via [this link](https://github.com/cybersheepdog/DetectionLabELK/archive/master.zip).
    - `cd` to "DetectionLabELK/Vagrant" and execute `vagrant up`.

2.  **Build Boxes From Scratch - ETA ~5 hours**.

    - [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) on your system.
    - [Install Packer](https://packer.io/downloads.html) on your system.
    - Install "Vagrant-Reload" plugin by running the following command: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload`.
    - Download DetectionLabELK to your local machine by running `git clone https://github.com/cybersheepdog/DetectionLabELK.git` from command line OR download it directly via [this link](https://github.com/cybersheepdog/DetectionLabELK/archive/master.zip).
    - `cd` to "DetectionLabELK" base directory and build the lab by executing `./build.sh virtualbox` (Mac & Linux) or `./build.ps1 virtualbox` (Windows).

## Troubleshooting:

- To verify that building process completed successfully, ensure you are in `DetectionLabELK/Vagrant` directory and run `vagrant status`. The four machines (wef,dc,logger and win10) should be running. if one of the machines was not running, execute `vagrant reload <host>`. If you would like to pause the whole lab, execute `vagrant suspend` and resume it using `vagrant resume`.
- Deployment logs will be present in the `Vagrant` folder as `vagrant_up_<host>.log`
